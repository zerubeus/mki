Ibn al-Qayyim said: \"There is no dispute that he was born, peace be upon him, in the heart of Mecca, and that his birth was in the Year of the Elephant.\" It is narrated from Ibn Abbas, may Allah be pleased with them both, that he said: (The Messenger of Allah, peace be upon him, was born in the Year of the Elephant), and this is what no scholar doubts. Khalifa ibn Khayyat, Ibn al-Jazari, Ibn Dihya, and Ibn al-Jawzi have reported consensus on this. As for his birth on Monday, it is narrated from Abu Qatadah al-Ansari, may Allah be pleased with him, that he said: \"The Prophet, peace be upon him, was asked about fasting on Mondays. He said: 'That is the day I was born, and the day I was sent (as a prophet) or the revelation was sent down to me.'\" Ibn Kathir said: \"Far be it, nay, he erred, who said: He was born on Friday the seventeenth of Rabi' al-Awwal.\" The point of disagreement was in determining the month and the day within it. Ibn Ishaq narrated from a group of the companions of the Messenger of Allah, peace be upon him, that they said to him: \"O Messenger of Allah, tell us about yourself.\" He said: (Yes, I am the supplication of my father Abraham, and the good news of Jesus, and my mother saw when she was pregnant with me that a light emerged from her that illuminated the palaces of Syria for her). His birth, peace be upon him, was after the death of his father Abdullah, as he was a fetus in his mother's womb when his father passed away, so the Prophet, peace be upon him, grew up an orphan. His birth took place in the house of Abu Talib in the valley of Banu Hashim.",

They were traveling on two camels. His mother disembarked with him at the house of al-Nabighah, near the grave of his father, Abdullah ibn Abd al-Muttalib.

Abdul Muttalib was a man of honor and virtue among his people, and Quraysh called him \"Al-Fadl\" (the Virtuous) due to his generosity and merit. He assumed the responsibilities of Rifadah (providing food for pilgrims) and Siqayah (providing water for pilgrims) after the death of his father, Hashim ibn Abd Manaf. Abdul Muttalib loved his grandson Muhammad with a great love, preferring him over all his other sons and showing him more tenderness than he showed his own children. Ibn Ishaq, may Allah have mercy on him, said: \"The Messenger of Allah, peace and blessings be upon him, was with his grandfather Abdul Muttalib ibn Hashim – meaning, after the death of his mother Aminah bint Wahb. A bed would be laid for Abdul Muttalib in the shade of the Kaaba, and his sons would sit around that bed until he came out to it. None of his sons would sit on it out of reverence for him. The Messenger of Allah, peace and blessings be upon him, would come as a young boy, strong and full, and sit on it. His uncles would try to pull him away from it, but when Abdul Muttalib saw that, he would say, 'Leave my son; by Allah, he has a great destiny.' Then he would seat him with him on his bed, stroke his back with his hand, and be pleased with what he saw him do.\" Abdul Muttalib would not eat food unless he said, \"Bring my son to me!\" and he would be brought to him. When Abdul Muttalib was nearing death, he bequeathed to Abu Talib the care and protection of the Messenger of Allah, peace and blessings be upon him.",

When Abd al-Muttalib was on his deathbed, he entrusted his son, Abu Talib, with the care and protection of the Messenger of God, peace and blessings be upon him, and to look after him. He entrusted him to Abu Talib because Abdullah, the father of the Prophet, peace and blessings be upon him, and Abu Talib were from the same mother. So, when Abd al-Muttalib died, Abu Talib was the one who took charge of the affairs of the Messenger of God, peace and blessings be upon him, after his grandfather. Ibn Sa'd and Ibn Asakir narrated from Ibn Abbas, may God be pleased with them, and others, who said: When Abd al-Muttalib passed away, Abu Talib took the Messenger of God, peace and blessings be upon him, and he would stay with him. Abu Talib loved him with an intense love, not loving his own children as much. He would not sleep except next to him, and he would favor him with food. When Abu Talib's children ate together or individually, they would not be full. But if the Messenger of God, peace and blessings be upon him, ate with them, they would be full. When Abu Talib intended to give them breakfast or dinner, he would say, \"Wait until my son arrives.\" Then the Messenger of God, peace and blessings be upon him, would come and eat with them, and they would have leftovers from their food. If he was not with them, their food would not be enough to fill them. If it was milk, he would drink first, then the children would take a large bowl, like a platter, and drink from it until they were all satisfied from that single bowl. One of them would even drink a whole bowl by himself. Abu Talib would then say, \"Indeed, you are blessed!\"",

      "details": "When the Prophet, peace be upon him, reached the age of twelve years, his uncle Abu Talib traveled to the Levant on a trade caravan, and he took him along. When the caravan camped at Busra, they passed by a monk there named Bahira, who was knowledgeable in the Gospel and an expert in Christianity. It was there that Bahira saw the Prophet, peace be upon him, and he began to observe him and speak with him. Then he turned to Abu Talib and asked, \"Who is this boy to you?\" Abu Talib replied, \"He is my son.\" (Abu Talib used to call him his son due to his intense love and compassion for him). Bahira said, \"He is not your son, and it is not fitting that the father of this boy should be alive.\" Abu Talib said, \"He is my nephew.\" Bahira asked, \"What happened to his father?\" Abu Talib replied, \"He died while his mother was pregnant with him.\" Bahira said, \"You have spoken the truth. Return him to his land and beware of the Jews, for by God, if they see him here, they will wish him great harm. For this nephew of yours is destined for a great matter.\" Abu Talib hastened back to Mecca with him.\n\nAl-Tirmidhi narrated that Abu Talib went out to the Levant, and the Prophet, peace be upon him, went out with him along with some elders of Quraysh. When they approached the monk (meaning Bahira), they dismounted and set up their camp. The monk came out to them. Previously, they used to pass by him, but he would not come out to them or pay them any attention. As they were setting up their camp, the monk went among them until he came and took the hand of the Messenger of Allah, peace be upon him, and said, \"This is the master of the worlds, this is the Messenger of the Lord of the worlds, whom Allah will send as a mercy to the worlds.\" Some elders of Quraysh said to him, \"What is your knowledge of this?\" He replied, \"When you approached from the mountain pass, no tree or stone remained but bowed in prostration, and only prophets bow in prostration. And I know him by the Seal of Prophethood below the cartilage of his shoulder, like an apple.\" Then he went back and prepared food for them. When he brought it to them, and the Prophet, peace be upon him, was tending to the camels, he said, \"Send for him.\" The Prophet, peace be upon him, came, and a cloud shaded him. When he approached the people, he found that they had preceded him to the shade of the tree. When the Messenger of Allah, peace be upon him, sat down, the shade of the tree moved to cover him. Bahira said, \"Look at the shade of the tree, how it has moved to him!\" While he was standing among them, he implored them not to take him to the Romans, for if the Romans saw him, they would recognize him by his description and kill him. He looked and saw seven men approaching from the direction of Rome. He met them and asked, \"What brings you here?\" They said, \"We have come because this Prophet is to emerge this month. No road was left without people being sent to it, and we have been informed of his news, so we were sent to this road of yours.\" He asked, \"Did anyone who is better than you precede you?\" They said, \"We were only informed of his news for this road of yours.\" He asked, \"If Allah wills something to happen, can any person prevent it?\" They said, \"No.\" He said, \"Then pledge allegiance to him, and they stayed with him.\" The monk Bahira said, \"I adjure you by Allah, who is his guardian?\" Abu Talib said, \"He kept imploring him until Abu Talib returned him.\"",

      "details": "When the Messenger of God, peace be upon him, reached fourteen or fifteen years of age, the War of Al-Fijar broke out between Quraysh and those with them from Kinanah, and Qays Aylan. This was one of the greatest days of the Arabs. The cause of this war was that Urwah Al-Rahhal, son of Utbah bin Rabiah, granted protection to a caravan belonging to Al-Nu'man bin Al-Mundhir. Al-Barrad bin Qays, one of the Banu Damrah bin Bakr bin Abd Manat bin Kinanah, said to him, \"Will you protect it against Kinanah?\" He replied, \"Yes, and against all creation.\" So Urwah Al-Rahhal set out, and Al-Barrad followed him, seeking an opportunity. When they were at Tayman Dhi Dhilal in Al-Aliyah, Urwah was caught unaware. Al-Barrad attacked him and killed him during the sacred month. This is why it was called the War of Al-Fijar. A messenger came to Quraysh and said, \"Al-Barrad has killed Urwah during the sacred month at Ukaz.\" They set out, and Hawazin were unaware. Then the news reached them, and they pursued them, catching up to them before they entered the sanctuary. They fought until nightfall, and then they entered the sanctuary, so Hawazin ceased their pursuit. After this day, the people met for many days, with each tribe of Quraysh and Kinanah having a leader from among them, and each tribe of Qays having a leader from among them. The Messenger of God, peace be upon him, witnessed some of their days, including the Day of Al-Nakhlah, when he was fourteen years old. Some say twenty years old. After their return from it, in Dhu al-Qi'dah, the Pact of Al-Fudul took place. The reason for it was that a man from Zabid, from Yemen, sold goods to Al-As bin Wa'il Al-Sahmi, who delayed paying him the price. The man climbed Mount Abu Qubais and cried out, mentioning his grievance. Quraysh then formed the Pact of Al-Fudul to support the oppressed. The Prophet, peace be upon him, witnessed this pact with them.",

Tribes of Quraysh were called to it: Banu Hashim, Banu Muttalib, Asad ibn Abd al-Uzza, Zuhrah ibn Kilab, and Taym ibn Murrah. They gathered in the house of Abdullah ibn Jud'an al-Taymi, due to his age and nobility. They made a pact and a covenant that if they found anyone oppressed in Mecca, whether from its people or others, they would stand with him and be against whoever oppressed him until his rights were restored. The Messenger of Allah, peace be upon him, witnessed this alliance and said about it: \"I witnessed an alliance in the house of Abdullah ibn Jud'an that I would not exchange for a herd of red camels, and if I were called to it in Islam, I would respond.\" This alliance contradicted the spirit of tribalistic pride that partisanship stirred. It is said that the reason for this alliance was that a man from Zubayd came to Mecca with merchandise, which Al-As ibn Wail al-Sahmi bought from him but withheld his payment. The man sought help from the allied tribes of Abd al-Dar, Makhzum, Jumah, Sahm, and Adi, but they paid him no heed. He then climbed Mount Abu Qubays and called out with verses describing his oppression, raising his voice. Al-Zubayr ibn Abd al-Muttalib then went forth and said, \"This cannot be left as is.\" They gathered and formed the alliance known as Hilf al-Fudul. Then they went to Al-As ibn Wail and retrieved the Zubaydi's right. The reason for its naming is that three men from the Jurhum tribe, namely Al-Fadl ibn Fadalah, Al-Fadl ibn Wada'ah, and Al-Fadl ibn al-Harith, had previously made a similar agreement. When the actions of the Quraysh resembled the actions of these early Jurhumis, all of whom were named Al-Fadl, the alliance was named Hilf al-Fudul.",

When they completed the journey, some payment was still due to her. Her partner began to approach them to collect the dues, and he would say to Muhammad, peace be upon him: \"Go.\" Muhammad would reply: \"You go, for I feel shy.\" One time, when her partner came to them, she asked: \"Where is Muhammad? Why doesn't he come with you?\" He said: \"I told him, but he claimed he felt shy.\" She mentioned this to her sister Khadijah, who said: \"I have never seen a man more shy, more chaste, or... than Muhammad, peace be upon him.\" This impressed Khadijah, so she sent for him and said: \"Go to my father and propose to him.\" He said: \"Your father is a man of great wealth, and he will not agree to this.\" She said: \"Go, meet him and speak to him, and I will handle the rest.\" The Prophet, peace be upon him, married her while she was a widow.",

Your people's caravan is ready to depart for Syria, and Khadijah bint Khuwaylid is sending men from your people with her caravans to trade her wealth, and they gain profits. If you were to approach her and offer yourself for her business, she would hasten to you and prefer you over others, due to what she has heard of your purity. Although I dislike you going to Syria and fear for you from the Jews, we have no choice.\"\n\nKhadijah bint Khuwaylid was a merchant woman of noble lineage, great wealth, and extensive trade that she sent to Syria. Her caravans were like those of the rest of Quraysh. She used to hire men and give them money for trade on a profit-sharing basis. News of the Prophet's truthful speech, his great trustworthiness, and his noble character reached Khadijah. So, she sent for him to manage her trade. He set out with her servant Maysarah until they reached Syria. His uncles had instructed the caravan members to look after him until he reached Syria. They camped in the market of Busra, under a tree near the monastery of a monk named Nestorius. The monk looked at Maysarah, whom he recognized, and said: \"O Maysarah, who is this who has camped under this tree?\" Maysarah replied: \"A man from Quraysh, from the people of the Sanctuary.\" The monk said: \"No one has ever camped under this tree except a prophet.\" Then the Messenger of Allah, peace and blessings be upon him, sold his goods, meaning his merchandise, and bought what he intended to buy. He then set off, returning to Mecca with Maysarah. When he arrived in Mecca with Khadijah's wealth, she sold what had come back for double its value or close to it. Maysarah told her about the monk's words and what he had witnessed of the Prophet's affairs. Thereupon, she proposed herself to him, may Allah be pleased with her. She was of the noblest lineage among the women of Quraysh, the most honorable, and the wealthiest. When she said this to the Messenger of Allah, peace and blessings be upon him, he mentioned it to his uncles. His uncle Hamzah went with him and approached Khuwaylid ibn Asad to propose marriage.

As for the Messenger of God, peace be upon him, God protected him through his uncle Abu Talib. As for Abu Bakr, his people protected him. As for the rest of them, the polytheists seized them, clothed them in iron armor, and roasted them in the sun. None of them escaped unharmed except that they complied with what the polytheists wanted and deceived them, except for Bilal. His soul was dear to him for the sake of God, the Almighty, and he was insignificant to his people. They seized him, gave him to the children, who paraded him through the valleys of Mecca, while he said: \"One, one.\" They put a rope around his neck and handed him over to the children to play with, until it left a mark on his neck. Bilal belonged to some of the Banu Jumah. The one who took the lead in torturing him was Umayyah ibn Khalaf. He would take him out when the midday heat was intense, throw him on his back in the open ground of Mecca, then order a large rock to be placed on his chest. Then he would say to him: \"You will remain like this until you die, or disbelieve in Muhammad and worship Al-Lat and Al-Uzza.\" While enduring this torture and affliction, he would say: \"One, one.\" It was as if his torture and affliction only increased his faith upon faith. Abu Bakr felt compassion for him when he saw him one day in this extreme humiliation, so he bought him and set him free, and he also freed six others who were being tortured for Islam.",

Nothing diverted him from this, no one turned him back, and no obstacle prevented him. He followed people to their gatherings, assemblies, and congregations, and during festivals and the pilgrimage seasons, calling to whoever he met, whether free or slave, weak or strong, rich or poor. The disbelievers of his people, the polytheists of Quraysh, oppressed him and those who followed him. Among the harshest of them towards him were his uncle Abu Lahab and his wife Umm Jamil, the firewood carrier – Arwa bint Harb bin Umayya, the sister of Abu Sufyan. His uncle Abu Talib bin Abdul Muttalib, however, was compassionate towards him, treated him well, defended him, and protected him, opposing his people in this matter, even though he remained on their religion. His continued adherence to his people's religion was part of God Almighty's wisdom and a protection He provided for His Messenger. For had Abu Talib embraced Islam, he would have had no standing or influence among the polytheists of Quraysh, nor would they have feared or respected him. The biographers narrated that Quraysh came to Abu Talib and said, \"Your nephew has annoyed us in our gathering place and our mosque; stop him from us.\" He said, \"O Aqil, go and bring Muhammad to me.\" So he brought him in the heat of the afternoon. When he came to them, Abu Talib said, \"These cousins of yours claim that you annoy them in their gathering place and their mosque; so cease annoying them.\" The Messenger of God, peace and blessings be upon him, raised his gaze to the sky and said, \"Do you see this sun?\" They said, \"Yes.\" He said, \"Then I am no more able to abandon that than you are to be ignited by a flame from it.\" Abu Talib then said, \"By God, my nephew has never lied.

The reason for his conversion was that Abu Jahl once passed by the Messenger of Allah, peace be upon him, near Safa, insulted him, and wronged him. The Messenger of Allah, peace be upon him, remained silent, not speaking to him. Then Abu Jahl struck him on the head with a stone, wounding him severely until blood flowed. He then left him and went to the gathering of Quraysh near the Kaaba and sat with them. A slave woman belonging to Abd Allah ibn Jud'an, in her dwelling on Safa, witnessed all of this. Hamzah arrived from hunting, his bow slung over his shoulder. The slave woman informed him of what she had seen Abu Jahl do. Hamzah became enraged and went out running, not stopping for anyone, intending to confront Abu Jahl if he met him. When he entered the Masjid, he stood over Abu Jahl and said, \"Do you curse my nephew while I am of his religion!\" Then he struck him with his bow, inflicting a terrible wound. Men from Banu Makhzum, Abu Jahl's tribe, rose up, and men from Banu Hashim, Hamzah's tribe, also rose up. Abu Jahl said, \"Leave Abu Imarah alone! For I have insulted his nephew with an ugly insult.\" Ibn Ishaq said: \"Then Hamzah returned to his house, and Satan came to him saying: 'You are the chief of Quraysh, yet you follow this apostate and abandon the religion of your forefathers. Death is better for you than what you have done.' Hamzah turned to himself and said: 'What have I done?! O Allah, if this is guidance, then make its confirmation in my heart. Otherwise, grant me a way out of what I have fallen into.' He spent a night such as he had never spent before, tormented by Satan's whispers, until morning. He then went to the Messenger of Allah, peace be upon him, and said: 'O nephew, I have fallen into a matter and do not know how to escape it. Is it guidance for someone like me to remain in a state I do not know whether it is right or grievous error? Tell me a story; I have longed, O nephew, for you to tell me.' The Messenger of Allah, peace be upon him, turned to him, reminded him, admonished him, warned him, and gave him good tidings. Allah then cast faith into his heart regarding what the Messenger of Allah, peace be upon him, had said. He said: 'I bear witness that you are truthful, a true testimony. Reveal your religion, O nephew, for by Allah, I would not wish to have all that the sky covers if it meant I were to return to my former religion.' Thus, Hamzah's embrace of Islam, may Allah be pleased with him, began as the pride of a man who refused to see his kinsman insulted. Then Allah expanded his chest, and he held fast to the firmest handhold, and the Muslims were greatly strengthened by him!",

When they were a short distance from Mecca, and they learned the truth of the matter, those who wished returned to Abyssinia, and none of the rest entered Mecca except in secret, or under the protection of a man from Quraysh. Then the affliction and torture from Quraysh intensified against them and the Muslims, and their tribes intervened on their behalf. It was difficult for Quraysh to accept what they heard from the Negus about good protection, and the Messenger of Allah, peace be upon him, saw no alternative but to advise his companions to emigrate to Abyssinia once again. The Muslims prepared for emigration again. Quraysh tried to thwart the second emigration operation, but the Muslims were faster and took refuge with the Negus of Abyssinia before they could be caught. Eighty-three men and eighteen or nineteen women emigrated. Quraysh sent Amr ibn al-As and Abdullah ibn Abi Rabi'ah, before they had embraced Islam, and sent with them valuable gifts for the Negus and his bishops. After they presented themselves to the Negus, they offered him the gifts and said to him: \"O King, there have come to your land foolish youths who have abandoned the religion of their people and have not entered your religion, and they have brought a new religion that neither we nor you know. Their noble kinsmen, their fathers, uncles, and tribes, have sent us to you to return them to them, for they are more concerned about them and know best what they have criticized them for.\" And they rebuked them for it. The bishops said: \"The King is right, so hand them over to them, so they can return them to their people and their land.\" The Negus sent for the Muslims and summoned them. They attended, having agreed to tell the truth, whatever the consequences. The Negus said to them: \"What is this religion that you have abandoned your people for, and have not entered my religion or the religion of any of these communities?\" Ja'far ibn Abi Talib – who was the spokesman for the Muslims – said: \"O King, we were a people of ignorance; we worshipped idols, ate carrion, committed indecencies, severed ties of kinship, mistreated neighbors, and the strong among us devoured the weak.\" He then enumerated the virtues of what the Prophet, peace be upon him, had brought them, and said: \"So we believed him, and we accepted him, and we followed him in the religion of Allah that he brought us. We worshipped Allah alone, associating nothing with Him. We forbade what was forbidden to us, and permitted what was permitted to us. Then our people attacked us, tortured us, and tried to turn us away from our religion, so that we would return to the worship of idols instead of the worship of Allah Almighty, and so that we would permit what we used to permit of evils. When they oppressed us, wronged us, made things difficult for us, and prevented us from practicing our religion, we came to your land, and we chose you over all others, and desired your protection, and hoped that we would not be wronged in your presence, O King.\" The Negus said to him: \"Do you have anything of what he brought from God?\" Ja'far said: \"Yes.\" The Negus said: \"Then recite it to me.\" So he recited to him a portion of Surah Maryam. The Negus wept until his beard was wet, and his bishops wept until their scriptures were wet when they heard what he recited to them. Then the Negus said to them: \"Indeed, this and what Jesus brought comes from the same source. Go, for by God, I will not hand them over to you, nor will they be able to.\" (addressing Amr ibn al-As and his companion). They left, and when they left, Amr ibn al-As said to Abdullah ibn Abi Rabi'ah: \"By God, tomorrow I will go to him about them with something that will uproot their existence.\" Abdullah ibn Abi Rabi'ah said to him: \"Do not do that, for they have kinship ties, even if they have opposed us.\" But Amr insisted on his opinion. The next day, he said to the Negus: \"O King, they say something great about Jesus, son of Mary.\" The Negus sent for them and asked them about their belief concerning the Messiah. They were frightened, but they agreed to tell the truth, whatever the consequences. When they entered and he asked them, Ja'far said: \"We say about him what our Prophet, peace be upon him, brought us: He is the servant of Allah, His Messenger, His Spirit, and His Word, which He cast to Mary, the pure virgin.\" The Negus took a twig from the ground and said: \"By God, Jesus, son of Mary, did not exceed what you have said with this twig.\" His bishops grumbled, and he said: \"Even if you grumble.\" Then he said to the Muslims: \"Go, you are safe in my land.\" (Al-Shuyum means safe in the Abyssinian language). Whoever insults you will pay a fine, whoever insults you will pay a fine, whoever insults you will pay a fine. I would not want a mountain of gold if it meant I had harmed one of you. (Al-Dabr means mountain in the Abyssinian language). Then he said to his retinue: \"Return their gifts to them, for I have no need of them. By God, Allah did not take bribes from me when He returned my kingdom to me, so I would take bribes in this matter. And He did not obey people concerning me, so I would obey them concerning Him.\" Umm Salamah said: \"So they left him, disgraced and with their mission rejected, and we stayed with him in the best of abodes, with the best of neighbors.\"",

He said, \"Give me this book you have so I can read it.\" His sister said, \"You are impure, and none shall touch it except the purified.

This was because the Quraysh were divided between those who were pleased with this pact and those who disliked it. So, those who disliked it sought to annul the document. The one who took the initiative was Hisham ibn Amr from Banu Amer ibn Lu'ayy. He used to secretly supply the Banu Hashim in the valley with food at night. He went to Zuhayr ibn Abi Umayyah al-Makhzumi, whose mother was Atikah bint Abd al-Muttalib, and said: \"O Zuhayr, are you content to eat food and drink, while your maternal uncles are in the state you know?\" He replied: \"Woe to you, what can I do?

He asked him: \"Is there anyone else for this matter you are calling me to?\" He said: \"Yes.\" Then he named the people to him. They gathered at al-Hajun and pledged to stand up to annul the document. Zuhayr said: \"I will start with you, so I will be the first to speak.\" When morning came, they went to their assemblies. Zuhayr went, wearing a garment, circled the Kaaba seven times, then turned to the people and said: \"O people of Mecca, do we eat food and wear clothes while Banu Hashim are perishing, and no one buys from or sells to them? By God, I will not sit down until this cutting and unjust document is torn.\" Abu Jahl, who was in a corner of the mosque, said: \"You lie, by God, it will not be torn.\" Zam'ah ibn al-Aswad said: \"By God, you are the liar. We did not agree to its writing when it was written.\" Abu al-Bukhtari said: \"Zam'ah has spoken the truth. We do not agree with what was written in it, nor do we acknowledge it.\" Al-Mu'tim ibn Adi said: \"You both have spoken the truth, and whoever says otherwise is a liar. We absolve ourselves before God of it and of what was written in it.\" Hisham ibn Amr said something similar. Abu Jahl then said: \"This is a matter decided at night, and discussed elsewhere.\" Abu Talib was sitting in a corner of the mosque. They came to them because God had informed His Messenger, peace be upon him, about the document and that He had sent the termite upon it, and it had eaten everything in it of injustice, severance, and oppression, except for the mention of God, the Mighty and Majestic. He informed his uncle, who went to the Quraysh and told them that his nephew had said such and such. He said: \"If he is lying, we will leave you to deal with him, and if he is telling the truth, you will cease your severance and injustice towards us.\" They said: \"You have been fair.\" After the discussion between the people and Abu Jahl, Al-Mu'tim stood up to tear the document, and found that the termite had eaten it except for \"(In Your Name, O Allah),\" and whatever mention of God was in it, it had not eaten. Then the document was annulled, and the Messenger of God, peace be upon him, and those with him, came out of the valley. The polytheists had seen a great sign of his prophethood, but they were as God described them: \"(And if they see a sign, they turn away and say, 'This is continuous magic.')\" They turned away from this sign and increased their disbelief.",

She believed in him when people disbelieved, she sheltered him when people rejected him, and she affirmed him when people denied him. Allah blessed him with children through her: Al-Qasim, At-Tayyib, and At-Tahir, who died in infancy, and Ruqayyah, Zaynab, Umm Kulthum, and Fatimah. May Allah be pleased with her. She passed away, along with Abu Talib, in the same year. The calamities followed one another for the Messenger of Allah, peace be upon him, with their deaths. Khadijah was a minister of truth for Islam, and the Prophet, peace be upon him, found solace in her. \"Khadijah passed away three years before the Prophet, peace be upon him, migrated to Medina. He remained for two years, or close to that, and married Aisha when she was six years old, and then consummated the marriage when she was nine years old.\" The Mother of the Believers, Khadijah bint Khuwaylid, may Allah be pleased with her, passed away in Mecca and was buried in Al-Hajun.",

Whenever he passed a tribe on the way, he invited them to Islam, but none responded. When he reached Taif, he approached its leaders and invited them, but they did not respond. He stayed among the people of Taif for ten days, visiting every one of their nobles and speaking to them. They told him, \"Leave our land.\" They incited their fools against him. When he intended to leave, the fools and their slaves followed him, insulting and shouting at him, until the people gathered against him. They formed two lines and began to stone him and hurl insults at him, and they stoned his heels until his sandals were stained with blood. Zayd ibn Harithah protected him with his own body, sustaining a head wound. The fools continued to harass him until they forced him to take refuge in a garden belonging to Utbah and Shaybah, sons of Rabi'ah, three miles from Taif. The Messenger of God, peace be upon him, returned on the road to Mecca after leaving the garden, dejected and sorrowful, with a broken heart. When he reached Qarn al-Manazil, God sent Gabriel to him, accompanied by the Angel of the Mountains, asking if he wished to crush the people of Mecca between the two mountains. The Prophet, peace be upon him, replied, \"Rather, I hope that God, the Almighty, will bring forth from their loins those who worship God, the Almighty, alone, associating nothing with Him.\" In this response given by the Messenger, peace be upon him, his unique character and his great moral disposition are evident.",

They said, 'O our people, indeed we have heard a Book revealed after Moses, confirming that which was before it, guiding to the truth and to a straight path. O our people, respond to the one who calls to Allah and believe in him. He will forgive for you your sins and protect you from a painful punishment.

He resolved to return there, and then it reached him that they had brothers in Medina, so he decided to migrate to them. Umm Salamah said: When Abu Salamah decided to go to Medina, he prepared a camel for me, then placed me upon it, and put my son Salamah ibn Abi Salamah in my lap. Then he went out leading my camel, and the Banu Abd al-Asad went with him, while the Banu Mughirah detained me with them, and my husband Abu Salamah went to Medina. She said: So I was separated from my son and my husband. She said: I used to go out every morning and sit in al-Abṭaḥ, and I would not stop crying until evening, for a year or close to it, until a man from my paternal uncles, one of the Banu Mughirah, passed by me and saw my state and took pity on me. He said to the Banu Mughirah: Will you not release this poor woman? Have you separated her from her husband and her child? She said: They then said to me: Go to your husband if you wish. She said: At that, the Banu Abd al-Asad returned my son to me. She said: So I prepared my camel, then took my son and placed him in my lap, then I set out to go to my husband in Medina. She said: And I had no one from God's creation with me, until when I reached al-Tan'im, I met Uthman ibn Talhah ibn Abi Talhah, brother of Banu Abd al-Dar. He said: Where are you going, O daughter of Umm Ayyah? I said: I am going to my husband in Medina. He said: Do you not have anyone with you? I said: I have no one with me except Allah and this son of mine. He said: By Allah, you are not to be left behind. He took the camel's reins and set out with me, hurrying me along. By Allah, I have never accompanied any man among the Arabs whom I considered more honorable than him. When he reached a stopping place, he would make the camel kneel, then he would move away from me until I dismounted. When I dismounted, he would move his camel away, unload it, then tie it to a tree. Then he would move to a tree and lie down beneath it. When it was time to depart, he would stand by my camel, prepare it, then move away from me and say: Mount. When I mounted and settled on my camel, he would come, take the reins, and lead me until he dismounted me. He continued to do this for me until he brought me to Medina. When he saw the village of Banu Amr ibn Awf in Quba, he said: Your husband is in this village. Abu Salamah was residing there, so enter it with the blessing of Allah. Then he returned to Mecca. Umm Salamah used to say: I do not know of any family in Islam that suffered what the family of Abu Salamah suffered, and I have never seen a companion more honorable than Uthman ibn Talhah.

We did not travel on the backs of camels except that we knew he was the Messenger of Allah, peace be upon him. And his departure today means the separation of all Arabs, the killing of your best men, and that swords will bite you. So if you are people who can endure this, your reward is with Allah.

      "details": "When the polytheists saw that the companions of the Messenger of Allah, peace and blessings be upon him, had prepared and departed, carrying and driving their families, children, and wealth to the Aws and Khazraj in Yathrib, they were overcome by gloom and sorrow, and anxiety and worry besieged them. The chieftains of Mecca gathered in Dar al-Nadwah to make a decisive decision on this matter. Their meeting took place approximately two and a half months after the Pledge of Aqabah. All the representatives of the Quraysh tribes converged for this meeting to discuss a decisive plan that would ensure the swift elimination of the Prophet, peace and blessings be upon him, and his call. When they arrived at Dar al-Nadwah at the appointed time, Iblis intercepted them in the guise of a venerable old man and stood at the door. They asked, \"Who is this old man?\" He replied, \"An old man from Najd who heard about what you have agreed upon and has come to join you to hear what you say, and perhaps he may offer you his opinion and advice.\" They said, \"Yes, enter.\" So he entered with them. After the meeting was complete and a lengthy discussion ensued, Abu al-Aswad said, \"Let us expel him from among us and banish him from our lands, and we will not care where he goes or where he ends up. We will have rectified our affairs and restored our unity as it was.\" The Najdi old man said, \"No, by God, this is not a good opinion for you. Have you not seen the eloquence of his speech, the sweetness of his tongue, and how he has captivated the hearts of men with what he brings? By God, if you do this, you will not be safe from him settling among some Arab tribe, and then marching with them against you, after they have followed him, until he tramples you in your lands and then does to you whatever he wishes. Devise a different plan for him.\" Abu al-Bakhtari said, \"Let us imprison him in chains and lock him behind a door, and then wait for him to meet the fate of those like him among the poets who came before him – Zuhayr and al-Nabighah – and those who have passed from this death, until he meets the same end.\" The Najdi old man said, \"No, by God, this is not a good opinion for you. By God, if you imprison him, as you say, his cause will emerge from behind the door you have locked him behind to his companions, and they will soon rise up against you, snatch him from your hands, and then increase their numbers against you until they overcome you in your affairs. This is not a good opinion for you, so consider something else.\" After this, the chief of Mecca's criminals, Abu Jahl ibn Hisham, came forward with a sinful proposal that was agreed upon by all present. Abu Jahl said, \"By God, I have an opinion on this that I do not think you have yet considered.\" They asked, \"And what is it, O Abu al-Hakam?\" He replied, \"I suggest that we take a strong, noble, and respected young man from each tribe. Then we give each of these young men a sharp sword, and they all go to him and strike him with a single blow, killing him. Thus, we will be rid of him. For if they do this, his blood will be dispersed among all the tribes, and the Banu Abd Manaf will not be able to fight all their people. They will then accept blood money from us, and we will pay it to them.\" The Najdi old man said, \"The statement is as the man said. This is the opinion, and there is no other opinion.\" They unanimously agreed to this sinful proposal.",

      "title": "The migration of the Messenger, peace be upon him, and Abu Bakr, may Allah be pleased with him, to Medina.",
      "details": "Aisha, may Allah be pleased with her, narrated that the Prophet, peace and blessings be upon him, said to the Muslims: \"I have been shown the land of your emigration, a land of date palms between two lava fields.\" These are the two Harrahs. So, those who had emigrated to Medina did so, and most of those who had emigrated to the land of Abyssinia returned to Medina. Abu Bakr prepared to go to Medina, and the Messenger of Allah, peace and blessings be upon him, said to him: \"Take it easy, for I hope I will be given permission.\" Abu Bakr said: \"May my father and mother be sacrificed for you, do you hope for that?\" He said: \"Yes.\" So Abu Bakr detained himself to accompany the Messenger of Allah, peace and blessings be upon him, and he fed two riding beasts he owned with the leaves of the samur tree – which is called khabat – for four months. Ibn Shihab said: Urwah said: Aisha said: One day, while we were sitting in Abu Bakr's house at the height of noon, someone said to Abu Bakr: \"Here is the Messenger of Allah, peace and blessings be upon him, veiled, at an hour he does not usually visit us.\" Abu Bakr said: \"May my father and mother be sacrificed for him, by Allah, he has not come at this hour except for something important.\" She said: The Messenger of Allah, peace and blessings be upon him, came and asked for permission, and he was granted permission and entered. The Prophet, peace and blessings be upon him, said to Abu Bakr: \"Send out those who are with you.\" Abu Bakr said: \"They are only your family, may my father and mother be sacrificed for you, O Messenger of Allah.\" He said: \"I have been given permission to leave.\" Abu Bakr said: \"To accompany you, may my father and mother be sacrificed for you, O Messenger of Allah?\" The Messenger of Allah, peace and blessings be upon him, said: \"Yes.\" Abu Bakr said: \"Then take, may my father and mother be sacrificed for you, O Messenger of Allah, one of these two riding beasts of mine.\" The Messenger of Allah, peace and blessings be upon him, said: \"For a price.\" Aisha said: We prepared them with the best possible preparation, and we made provisions for them in a waterskin. Asma bint Abi Bakr cut a piece from her belt and tied it around the mouth of the waterskin. It was because of this that she was named \"Dhat al-Nitaqayn\" (She of the Two Belts). She said: Then the Messenger of Allah, peace and blessings be upon him, and Abu Bakr joined them in a cave on Mount Thawr, and they hid there for three nights. Abdullah ibn Abi Bakr, a young, intelligent, and quick-witted boy, would spend the night with them, and then leave them before dawn to be with Quraysh in Mecca as if he had spent the night there. He would hear nothing of any plan devised against them without memorizing it, until he would bring them news of it when darkness fell. Amir ibn Fuhayrah, the freed slave of Abu Bakr, would bring them a herd of sheep for grazing, and bring them to rest with them when an hour after Isha had passed. They would spend the night on the milk of their herd and their drink until Amir ibn Fuhayrah would call them at dawn. He did this every night of those three nights. The Messenger of Allah, peace and blessings be upon him, and Abu Bakr hired a man from the tribe of Banu al-Dil, who was from Banu Abd ibn Adi, a guide and an expert navigator – and an expert navigator is one skilled in guidance. He had an alliance with the family of Al-As ibn Wa'il al-Sahmi, and he was on the religion of the disbelievers of Quraysh. So they entrusted him with their riding beasts and agreed to meet him at the cave of Thawr after three nights, with their riding beasts, on the morning of the third day. Amir ibn Fuhayrah and the guide set off with them, and they took the coastal route. Surraqah ibn Ju'shum said: Messengers from the disbelievers of Quraysh came to us, offering a reward for the Messenger of Allah, peace and blessings be upon him, and Abu Bakr, whoever killed or captured either of them. While I was sitting in a gathering of my people, Banu Mudlij, a man from them came and stood before us while we were sitting, and said: \"O Surraqah, I have just seen some dark shapes on the coast. I think it is Muhammad and his companions.\" Surraqah said: I knew it was them, so I said to him: \"They are not them, but you saw so-and-so and so-and-so. They have gone from our sight.\" I then remained in the gathering for a while, then I got up and went inside and ordered my slave girl to bring out my horse from behind a hill and keep it for me. I took my spear and went out with it from the back of the house, and I struck its tip against the ground, and lowered its upper part, until I reached my horse and mounted it. I urged it on, and it brought me closer, until I was near them. My horse stumbled, and I fell off it. I got up and reached for my quiver, and took out the arrows for divination, and cast lots to see if I would harm them or not. The result I disliked came out. I mounted my horse and disobeyed the arrows, and it brought me closer, until when I heard the recitation of the Messenger of Allah, peace and blessings be upon him, and he did not look back, and Abu Bakr kept looking back, my horse's legs sank into the ground, up to its knees. I fell off it, then I urged it on and it rose, and it could hardly pull its legs out. When it stood upright, there was a cloud of dust rising into the sky like smoke from the tracks of its legs. I cast lots again, and the result I disliked came out. I called out to them offering safety, and they stopped. I mounted my horse and rode until I reached them. When I encountered what I encountered of being held back from them, it occurred to me that the cause of the Messenger of Allah, peace and blessings be upon him, would prevail. I said to him: \"Your people have offered a reward for you, and I informed them of what people intended for them. I offered them provisions and supplies, but they did not take anything from me nor ask me, except that he said: 'Conceal yourselves from us.'\" I asked him to write me a letter of security, so he ordered Amir ibn Fuhayrah to write it on a piece of leather. Then the Messenger of Allah, peace and blessings be upon him, departed. Urwah ibn al-Zubayr narrated that the Messenger of Allah, peace and blessings be upon him, met al-Zubayr with a group of Muslims who were traders returning from Syria. Al-Zubayr clothed the Messenger of Allah, peace and blessings be upon him, and Abu Bakr in white garments. The Muslims in Medina heard of the Messenger of Allah's departure from Mecca, so they would go out every morning to the Harrah and wait for him until the heat of noon drove them back. One day, after waiting for a long time, they returned. When they returned to their homes, a man from the Jews climbed one of their fortresses to look at something. He saw the Messenger of Allah, peace and blessings be upon him, and his companions, dressed in white, shimmering in the heat haze. The Jew could not help but say in a loud voice: \"O Arabs, this is your ancestor whom you await!\" The Muslims rushed to their weapons and met the Messenger of Allah, peace and blessings be upon him, at the back of the Harrah. He turned them to the right, until he settled them in the territory of Banu Amr ibn Awf. This was on Monday in the month of Rabi al-Awwal. Abu Bakr stood up for the people, and the Messenger of Allah, peace and blessings be upon him, sat in silence. Those who came from the Ansar – who had not seen the Messenger of Allah, peace and blessings be upon him – began to greet Abu Bakr, until the sun shone on the Messenger of Allah, peace and blessings be upon him. Abu Bakr came and shaded him with his cloak, and then the people recognized the Messenger of Allah, peace and blessings be upon him.",

On that day, men from among the Muslims were praying there. It was a date palm drying ground belonging to Suhail and Sahl, two orphaned boys under the care of As'ad ibn Zurarah. When his riding beast knelt, the Messenger of God, peace be upon him, said, \"This, God willing, is the place of dwelling.\" Then the Messenger of God, peace be upon him, called the two boys and negotiated with them for the drying ground to make it a mosque. They said, \"No, rather we gift it to you, O Messenger of God.\" But the Messenger of God refused to accept it as a gift until he bought it from them. Then he built a mosque. The Messenger of God, peace be upon him, began to carry bricks with them in its construction, and while carrying bricks, he would say, \"This is a burden, not the burden of Khaybar. This is more righteous and purer for our Lord.\" And he would say, \"O God, the reward is the reward of the Hereafter, so have mercy on the Ansar and the Muhajirun.\"\n\nAnas, may God be pleased with him, said: The Prophet, peace be upon him, arrived in Medina and stayed in the upper part of the city in a tribe called Banu 'Amr ibn 'Awf. The Prophet, peace be upon him, stayed with them for fourteen nights. Then he sent for Banu an-Najjar, and they came, girded with swords, as if I were looking at the Prophet, peace be upon him, on his riding beast, with Abu Bakr behind him, and the notables of Banu an-Najjar around him, until he arrived at the courtyard of Abu Ayyub. He used to like to pray wherever prayer found him, and to pray in sheep pens. He ordered the construction of the mosque, so he sent for a group of Banu an-Najjar and said, \"O Banu an-Najjar, name your price for this courtyard of yours.\" They said, \"By God, we will not ask for its price except from God.\" Anas said: It contained, as I tell you, the graves of the polytheists, ruins, and palm trees. The Prophet, peace be upon him, ordered the graves of the polytheists to be exhumed, then the ruins to be leveled, and the palm trees to be cut down. They lined up the palm trees as the qiblah of the mosque, made its doorposts of stone, and began to carry rocks, chanting, and the Prophet, peace be upon him, was with them, saying, \"O God, there is no good except the good of the Hereafter, so forgive the Ansar and the Muhajirun.\" Abdullah ibn Umar said: The mosque in the time of the Messenger of God, peace be upon him, was built with bricks, its roof was made of palm fronds, and its columns were made of palm wood.",

When the verse {And for each, We have appointed heirs} was revealed, it abrogated that. Then he said: {And those with whom your right hands have covenanted} meaning: \"Except for support, assistance, and sincere advice. Inheritance was then abolished, but one would still make a will for them.\"\n\nAnas narrated: When the Prophet, peace be upon him, arrived in Medina, the Emigrants came to him and said: \"O Messenger of Allah, we have not seen a people more generous than those among whom we have landed, nor more compassionate with little than they are with much. They have spared us hardship and shared their ease with us, to the extent that we fear they will take all the reward.\" The Prophet, peace be upon him, replied: \"Not so, as long as you supplicate to Allah for them and praise them.\"\n\nAbd al-Rahman ibn Awf, may Allah be pleased with him, said: When we arrived in Medina, the Messenger of Allah, peace be upon him, established brotherhood between me and Sa'd ibn al-Rabi'.

Is there a market where trade occurs?\" He said: \"The market of Qaynuqa'.\" Abd al-Rahman went there and brought back some dried yogurt and ghee. He continued to go daily, and before long, Abd al-Rahman returned with a trace of yellow on him.

The Messenger of God had written him a letter and ordered him not to look at it until he had traveled for two days, then to look at it. When he opened the letter, he found: \"When you look at this letter of mine, proceed until you descend to Nakhlah, between Mecca and Ta'if, and scout Quraysh there, and learn their news for us.\" He said, \"We hear and obey,\" and informed his companions of this, stating that he did not compel them. Whoever desired martyrdom should proceed, and whoever disliked death should return. As for me, I am proceeding. So they all proceeded. While on the way, Sa'd ibn Abi Waqqas and Utbah ibn Ghazwan lost a camel they were sharing, so they fell behind to search for it. Abdullah ibn Jahsh proceeded until he reached Nakhlah. A caravan of Quraysh passed by him carrying raisins, dried meat, and merchandise, which included Amr ibn al-Hadrami, Uthman and Nawfal ibn Abdullah ibn al-Mughirah, and al-Hakam ibn Kaysan, a freed slave of Banu al-Mughirah.

When Umayr returned, he found her sons with a group burying her. They said, \"O Umayr, did you kill her?\" He replied, \"Yes, so plot against me all together, then give me no respite.

Abu Sufyan later learned of the Muslims' departure and sent a message to Quraysh calling for their aid to rescue their trade. He also changed his route to save the caravan. Then, the Muslims and the polytheists met at Badr, a place between Mecca and Medina, and closer to Medina than Mecca. The number of polytheists was nearly a thousand, while the number of Muslims was over three hundred. The battle began with the famous duel, then the fighting started and was intense. Prominent leaders of Quraysh, such as Abu Jahl and Umayyah ibn Khalaf, and others were killed, with their total dead reaching seventy men and the same number taken captive. Fourteen Muslims were killed, and some say sixteen. Thus, a great victory was achieved by the Muslims. God Almighty aided them and sent angels to fight alongside them. Regarding the captives, Umar suggested killing them, while Abu Bakr suggested ransoming them. The Prophet, peace be upon him, accepted Abu Bakr's opinion, but revelation descended in agreement with Umar's view. As for the spoils of war, the chapter of Al-Anfal was revealed concerning them.",

Abu Afak was from the Banu Amr bin Awf, an old man who had reached the age of one hundred and twenty years. He was a Jew, greatly disbelieving, and a harsh critic of the Muslims. His heart was filled with hatred and envy towards the Muslims as he saw the Aws and Khazraj rallying to support the Messenger of Allah, peace be upon him. His malice towards Islam and its people intensified after he saw the Messenger of Allah, peace be upon him, growing stronger and more established in Medina and its surroundings after the Battle of Badr. He could not bear it, so he began to recite poetry, denouncing the Messenger of Allah, peace be upon him, inciting enmity towards him, and ridiculing the opinion of the Ansar for following and supporting the Messenger of Allah, peace be upon him. Salim bin Umayr, who was one of the \"weepers\" – meaning during the Battle of Tabuk – and a participant in the Battle of Badr, said: \"I vow to kill Abu Afak or die trying.\" He waited, seeking an opportunity, until one summer night when Abu Afak slept in the courtyard.

So he set out with two hundred riders from Quraysh, to fulfill his oath. He reached the outskirts of Medina at night and sought refuge with Banu Nadir. He went to Huyayy ibn Akhtab and knocked on his door, but Huyayy refused to open it for him, fearing him. So Abu Sufyan turned away from him to Salam ibn Mishkam, who was the chief of Banu Nadir at that time and the keeper of their treasure. Abu Sufyan asked for permission to enter, and he was granted it. Salam hosted him, gave him wine to drink, and informed him of the news of the Messenger of Allah, peace be upon him. Then Abu Sufyan left in the latter part of that night and went to his companions. He sent some men from Quraysh, who went to an area of Medina called Al-Arid – a valley in Medina. They set fire to the fruit-bearing trees and date palms of the Muslims. They found a man from the Ansar and his ally in their fields and killed them, then they turned back. When this news reached the Messenger of Allah, peace be upon him, he set out in pursuit of them with two hundred of the Emigrants and Helpers. He appointed Abu Lubaba Bashir ibn Abd al-Mundhir, may Allah be pleased with him, as governor of Medina. Abu Sufyan and his companions began to throw down sacks of saweeq – roasted wheat or barley, then ground, and used as provisions, mixed with water, ghee, or honey – which was the majority of their provisions, to lighten their load for escape. The Messenger of Allah, peace be upon him, reached Qaraqarah al-Kadr – Qaraqarah: level ground. Al-Kadr: a water source belonging to Banu Sulaym, and the origin of Kadr is a bird with a dusky color, after which the place or water was named. Then he turned back towards Medina, as Abu Sufyan and his companions had escaped him. The Messenger of Allah, peace be upon him, was away for five days. When the Messenger of Allah, peace be upon him, returned with them, the Muslims said, \"O Messenger of Allah, do you hope that this will be a raid for us?\" He said, \"Yes.\" This raid is also called the \"Raid of Saweeq\" because the most of what the people threw away from their provisions was saweeq, so the Muslims returned with a lot of saweeq.

When the Battle of Badr occurred, he was disheartened and humiliated, saying, \"The belly of the earth is better than its surface today.\" He then went to Mecca, wept for the slain Quraysh, and incited them with poetry. Jabir ibn Abdullah narrated that the Messenger of Allah, peace be upon him, said, \"Who will deal with Ka'b ibn al-Ashraf?

The reason for it was that the Messenger of Allah, peace and blessings be upon him, received news that a group from Banu Tha'labah ibn Sa'id ibn Dhubyan ibn Baghidh ibn Ra'ith ibn Ghatafan, and Banu Muharib ibn Khasafah ibn Qays, at Dhu Amarr, had gathered, intending to raid the frontiers of the Messenger of Allah, peace and blessings be upon him. A man from them, called Du'thur ibn Al-Harith ibn Muharib, had united them. So, the Messenger of Allah, peace and blessings be upon him, summoned the Muslims and set out with four hundred and fifty men, accompanied by several horses. He appointed Uthman ibn Affan as his deputy in Medina. They encountered a man from them at Dhu al-Qassah, called Jabbar from Banu Tha'labah. The Muslims asked him, \"Where are you going?\" He replied, \"I am going to Yathrib to scout for myself and look around.\" He was brought to the Messenger of Allah, peace and blessings be upon him, and informed him of their news. The Messenger of Allah, peace and blessings be upon him, said, \"They will not meet you. If they hear of your march, they will flee to the mountain tops. I am going with you.\" So, the Messenger of Allah, peace and blessings be upon him, invited Jabbar to Islam, and he embraced Islam. The Messenger of Allah, peace and blessings be upon him, attached him to Bilal, and Jabbar led them along a path, bringing them down to them. The people heard of the march of the Messenger of Allah, peace and blessings be upon him, and fled to the mountain tops. The Messenger of Allah, peace and blessings be upon him, reached a water source called Dhu Amarr and camped there. The Messenger of Allah, peace and blessings be upon him, and his companions were struck by heavy rain, and the clothes of the Messenger of Allah, peace and blessings be upon him, and his companions became wet. So, the Messenger of Allah, peace and blessings be upon him, descended under a tree and spread his clothes to dry, and lay down, while the polytheists could see him. The Muslims were occupied with their affairs. The polytheists sent a brave man from them, called Du'thur ibn Al-Harith, who was their chief and bravest. He was girded with a sword. Du'thur rushed forward, drawing his sword, until he stood over the Messenger of Allah, peace and blessings be upon him, with his sword drawn, and said, \"O Muhammad, who will protect you from me today?\" The Messenger of Allah, peace and blessings be upon him, replied, \"Allah.\" Gabriel pushed him in the chest, and the sword fell from his hand. The Messenger of Allah, peace and blessings be upon him, took it and said to him, \"Who will protect you from me?!\" He replied, \"No one.\" And I bear witness that there is no god but Allah, and that Muhammad is the Messenger of Allah. By Allah, I will never gather a force against you again. So, the Messenger of Allah, peace and blessings be upon him, gave him his sword. Then he came to his people, and they asked him, \"What happened to you? Woe to you!\" He said, \"I saw a tall man who pushed me in the chest, and I fell on my back. I knew he was an angel, and I testified that Muhammad is the Messenger of Allah. By Allah, I will never gather a force against him again.\" And he began to call his people to Islam. And Allah, the Almighty, revealed: \"O you who have believed, remember the favor of Allah upon you when a people intended to extend their hands [in aggression] against you, but He restrained their hands from you.\" [Al-Ma'idah, 11]. And the Messenger of Allah, peace and blessings be upon him, returned to Medina without encountering any harm. His absence was fifteen nights.

After finishing, he prayed over a man from Banu Najjar, named Malik ibn Amr. He then consulted the people, asking whether they should march out to meet the enemy or remain in Medina. Abdullah ibn Ubayy suggested staying in Medina. He argued that if they stayed, they would be in a terrible confinement, and if the enemy entered, the men would fight them face-to-face, while the women and children would pelt them with stones from above. If the enemy retreated, they would return in defeat. Other Companions, who had not witnessed Badr, suggested marching out to meet them. The Messenger of Allah, peace be upon him, went inside, donned his armor, and marched out to meet them.\n\nHe set out with a thousand of his Companions. When they reached a place called Ash-Shawtt, Abdullah ibn Ubayy turned back with a third of the army, angered because his opinion had not been heeded. He and his followers said: \"If we knew there would be fighting today, we would have followed you, but we do not see you fighting today.\" The Messenger of Allah, peace be upon him, continued his march until he reached the valley of Uhud, at the entrance of the valley. He positioned his back and his camp towards Uhud and prepared for battle with seven hundred of his Companions. He appointed Abdullah ibn Jubayr, brother of Banu Amr ibn Awf, as the commander of the archers, who numbered fifty men that day. He instructed them: \"Repel the cavalry from us with arrows, so they do not come at us from behind. Whether we gain victory or suffer defeat, remain in your position, so that we are not attacked from your side.\" The Messenger of Allah, peace be upon him, wore two coats of mail and gave the banner to Mus'ab ibn Umayr, brother of Banu Abd ad-Dar. The Messenger of Allah, peace be upon him, permitted some of the young boys to participate that day and deferred others.\n\nQuraysh mobilized, numbering three thousand men, with two hundred horses prepared for battle. They appointed Khalid ibn al-Walid to command the right flank of the cavalry and Ikrimah ibn Abi Jahl to command the left flank. The banner was given to Banu Abd ad-Dar.\n\nThen, what happened between the two factions occurred. Initial signs of victory began to appear for the Muslims. When the Muslims saw the polytheists retreating, the archers neglected the Prophet's command to them and descended to collect spoils. Khalid ibn al-Walid seized the opportunity, circled behind them, and engaged them in battle, which led to a reversal of fortunes. The battle concluded with the martyrdom of seventy Muslims, including Hamzah ibn Abd al-Muttalib, Mus'ab ibn Umayr, Abdullah ibn Haram, the father of Jabir, and Abdullah ibn Jubayr, the commander of the archers.",

He was informed that Tulayhah and Salamah, the sons of Khuwaylid, had gathered their people and those who obeyed them to wage war against the Messenger of Allah, peace be upon him.

When I reached the valley of Urnah, I met him walking, with a group of Abyssinians behind him. When I saw him, I was awestruck by him and recognized him by the description the Messenger of Allah, peace be upon him, had given me. I said: Allah and His Messenger have spoken the truth. The time for Asr prayer had arrived when I saw him, so I prayed while walking, gesturing with my head. When I approached him, he said: \"Who is the man?\" I said: \"A man from Khuzā'ah. I heard about your gathering against Muhammad, so I came to be with you in it.\" He said: \"Yes; I am indeed among those gathered against him.\" So I walked with him and talked to him. He found my conversation pleasant, and I recited poetry to him, saying: \"How strange is what Muhammad has introduced of this new religion! He has abandoned the ways of our fathers and deemed their wisdom foolish.\" He said: \"I have not met anyone like me, nor anyone who fights as well as I do.\" He was leaning on a staff, striking the ground with it, until he reached his tent, and his companions dispersed to nearby dwellings, while they surrounded him. He said: \"Come here, O brother of Khuzā'ah.\" I approached him. He said: \"Sit down.\" I sat with him until the people calmed down and slept. I took advantage of the opportunity. In most narrations, it is said that I walked with him until, when I had the opportunity, I struck him with my sword and killed him, and took his head. Then I turned and ascended a mountain, and entered a cave. The pursuit of horses and men came from all directions, while I was hidden in the cave. A man approached with his water skin and sandals in his hand. I was afraid. He put down his water skin and sandals and sat down to urinate near the mouth of the cave. Then he said to his companions: \"There is no one in the cave.\" So they turned back. I went out to the water skin, drank what was in it, and took the two sandals and put them on. I traveled by night and hid by day until I came to Medina. I found the Messenger of Allah, peace be upon him, in the mosque. When he saw me, he said: \"May your face be successful.\" I said: \"And may your face be successful, O Messenger of Allah.\" I placed the head before him and told him my story. He gave me a staff and said: \"Use this to lean on in Paradise; for those who lean on staffs in Paradise are few.\" The staff remained with Abdullah bin Unais until his death approached. He instructed his family to wrap the staff in his shroud. They did so. Ibn 'Uqbah said: \"They claim that the Messenger of Allah, peace be upon him, informed them of Abdullah bin Unais killing Sufyan bin Khalid before Abdullah bin Unais, may Allah Almighty be pleased with him, arrived.\"",

They set out until they reached Al-Hada, which is between Usfan and Mecca. They were discovered by a tribe of Hudhayl called Banu Lihyan. Nearly two hundred archers from their tribe mobilized and tracked their footsteps until they found traces of their meal, dates they had provisioned from Medina. They said, \"These are dates from Yathrib.\" They continued to track their footsteps. When Asim and his companions saw them, they took refuge in a mound of sand, and the enemy surrounded them. They called out to them, \"Come down and surrender yourselves, and you will have our covenant and pledge, and we will not kill any of you.\" Asim bin Thabit, the commander of the detachment, said, \"As for me, by Allah, I will not descend under the protection of a disbeliever today. O Allah, inform Your Prophet about us.\" So they shot arrows at them, and killed Asim and seven of his companions. Three men then descended to them under the covenant and pledge: Khubayb Al-Ansari, Ibn Dathinah, and another man. When they had control over them, they loosened the strings of their bows and bound them. The third man said, \"This is the first act of treachery. By Allah, I will not accompany you. I have an example in these slain men,\" referring to the killed companions. They dragged him and tried to persuade him to accompany them, but he refused, so they killed him. They then took Khubayb and Ibn Dathinah and sold them in Mecca after the Battle of Badr. Khubayb was bought by the sons of Al-Harith bin Amir bin Nawfal bin Abd Manaf. Khubayb had killed Al-Harith bin Amir on the day of Badr. Khubayb remained a captive with them. Ubayd Allah bin Iyad informed me that the daughter of Al-Harith told him that when they gathered, she lent Khubayb a razor to shave with. She said that she found him sitting on his thigh with the razor in his hand, holding her son. She was frightened, a fear that Khubayb recognized in her face. He said, \"Are you afraid that I will kill him? I would never do that. By Allah, I have never seen a better captive than Khubayb. By Allah, I once found him eating a bunch of grapes in his hand, while he was bound in chains, and there were no fruits in Mecca at that time.\" She used to say, \"This is sustenance from Allah that He provided for Khubayb.\" When they went out of the sanctuary to kill him in the open, Khubayb said to them, \"Let me pray two rak'ahs.\" They let him. He prayed two rak'ahs, then said, \"Were it not that you would think I was afraid, I would have prolonged it. O Allah, count them and destroy them. Then he recited:\n\"I do not care when I am killed as a Muslim,\nOn whichever side it may be for Allah's decree.\nAnd if He wills, He will bless the scattered limbs.\nAl-Harith's son killed him. Khubayb was the one who initiated the two rak'ahs for every Muslim who is killed patiently. Allah answered the prayer of Asim bin Thabit when he was struck. The Prophet, peace and blessings be upon him, informed his companions of their news and what had befallen them. Some of the disbelievers of Quraysh sent to Asim, when they heard he was killed, to bring something from him as identification. He had killed one of their great men on the day of Badr. Then, a swarm of wasps, like a canopy, was sent upon Asim, and it protected him from their messengers, so they were unable to cut any of his flesh.",

When he was on his way back to Medina, he killed two men from Banu 'Amir, who had a treaty and a pledge of safety from the Messenger of Allah, peace be upon him, which 'Amr did not know about. When he returned, he informed the Messenger of Allah, peace be upon him... So the Messenger of Allah, peace be upon him, went out to Banu an-Nadir seeking their help in the blood money for those two men. The dwellings of Banu an-Nadir were outside Medina, a few miles to its east. Muhammad ibn Ishaq ibn Yasar said in his book \"Al-Sirah\": Then the Messenger of Allah went out to Banu an-Nadir, seeking their help in the blood money for those two killed men from Banu 'Amir, whom 'Amr ibn Umayyah al-Dhamri had killed, due to the protection that the Messenger of Allah, peace be upon him, had granted them... When the Messenger of Allah, peace be upon him, came to them seeking their help in the blood money for those two killed men, they said: Yes, O Abu al-Qasim, we will help you in whatever you wish and have sought our help for. Then they conferred among themselves and said: You will not find the man in such a situation as this – and the Messenger of Allah, peace be upon him, was beside a wall of their houses – so who will go up onto this house and throw a rock at him, and rid us of him? 'Amr ibn Jahsh ibn Ka'b, one of them, volunteered and said: I will do it. So he climbed up to throw a rock at him as they had said, and the Messenger of Allah, peace be upon him, was with a group of his companions, including Abu Bakr, 'Umar, and 'Ali, may Allah be pleased with them. Then the news came to the Messenger of Allah, peace be upon him, from heaven about what the people intended, so he stood up and left, returning to Medina. When the Prophet, peace be upon him, was delayed, his companions went looking for him and met a man coming from Medina. They asked him about him, and he said: I saw him entering Medina. So the companions of the Messenger of Allah, peace be upon him, came back until they reached him, and he informed them of the news of what the Jews had intended to do to him treacherously. And the Messenger of Allah, peace be upon him, ordered them to prepare for war against them and to march towards them. Then he marched until he reached them, and they fortified themselves in their fortresses. The Messenger of Allah, peace be upon him, ordered the cutting down and burning of their palm trees. They called out to him: O Muhammad, you used to forbid corruption and criticize those who did it, so what about cutting down and burning the palm trees?! A group from Banu 'Awf ibn al-Khazraj, including 'Abdullah ibn Ubayy ibn Salul, Wardi'ah, Malik ibn Abi Qawqal, Suwayd, and Da'is, had sent to Banu an-Nadir saying: Stand firm and resist, for we will not hand you over. If you are fought, we will fight with you, and if you are expelled, we will go out with you. They waited for this support from them, but it did not come, and Allah cast terror into their hearts. So they asked the Messenger of Allah, peace be upon him, to expel them and spare their blood, on the condition that they would have whatever their camels could carry of their property, except for the rings. So he agreed. They carried away from their property what the camels could bear, and a man among them would dismantle his house from the frame of his door, place it on the back of his camel, and take it away. So they went out to Khaybar, and some of them went to Syria, leaving the property to the Messenger of Allah, peace be upon him, and it was exclusively for the Messenger of Allah. It is confirmed in Sahih al-Bukhari that the Prophet, peace be upon him, expelled Banu an-Nadir. And the Surah Al-Hashr was revealed concerning them.",

This was in anticipation of the arrival of the Quraysh according to the appointed time set since the Battle of Uhud with Abu Sufyan, the leader of the Quraysh. The Muslims waited for eight days without the Quraysh arriving. Abu Sufyan had set out with two thousand men and fifty horses. When they reached Marr al-Dhuhran, forty miles from Mecca, they turned back, claiming that the year was one of drought. Their breaking of the promise had the effect of strengthening the position of the Muslims and restoring their prestige. The Muslims continued to send their detachments to various parts of Najd and Hijaz to discipline the Bedouins. Abu Ubaidah ibn al-Jarrah led a detachment to Tayy and Asad in Najd, and they dispersed into the mountains without any fighting occurring.

When the Jews of Khaybar, especially Banu Nadir, could not confront the Muslims, they resorted to cunning and incitement. Ibn Ishaq mentioned, with his chain of narration from a group, that those who incited the Confederates were a group of Jews, including: Sallam bin Abi al-Huqayq, Huyayy bin Akhtab al-Nadari, Kinanah bin Abi al-Huqayq al-Nadari, Hawdha bin Qays al-Wa'ili, and Abu Ammar al-Wa'ili, along with a group from Banu Nadir.

Anas (may Allah be pleased with him) narrated: \"The Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him) went out to the trench, and the Muhajirun and Ansar were digging on a cold morning. They had no slaves to do this for them. When he saw their exhaustion and hunger, he said: 'O Allah, verily, life is the life of the Hereafter, so forgive the Ansar and the Muhajirah.'

So send down tranquility upon us, and make our feet firm if we meet the enemy. Indeed, those who have wronged us have rebelled against us, and if they intended to try us, we would refuse.'\" He said: \"Then he would extend his voice with the last part of it.\"\n\nAisha (may Allah be pleased with her) said regarding the verse: \"{When they came upon you from above you and from below you, and when eyes shifted and hearts reached the throats...}\" (Quran 33:10), \"That was the day of the trench.\"\n\nWhen the Confederates reached Medina, they were surprised by the presence of the trench, and they made several attempts to breach it, but they failed.

He was in an upper chamber. When his guests left, I went up to him. As I opened each door, I locked it behind me from the inside. I said: \"If the people realize I am here, they will not be able to reach me until I kill him.\" I reached him, and he was in a dark room amidst his family. I did not know where he was in the room. I said: \"O Abu Rafi',\" he said: \"Who is this?\" I moved towards the voice and struck him with a sword, in my bewilderment. It did not avail him, and he cried out. I left the room and stayed a short distance away, then I returned to him and said: \"What is this sound, O Abu Rafi'?\" He said: \"Woe to your mother, a man was in the room and struck me with a sword before.\" He said: \"I struck him a blow that wounded him deeply but did not kill him. Then I placed the tip of the sword in his belly until it went through his back. I knew then that I had killed him. I began to open the doors, one by one, until I reached a staircase. I placed my foot, thinking I had reached the ground, and fell on a moonlit night. My leg broke. I tied it with my turban, then I set off until I sat by the door. I said: 'I will not leave tonight until I know if I have killed him.' When the rooster crowed, the announcer stood on the wall and said: 'I announce the death of Abu Rafi', the merchant of the people of Hijaz.' I went to my companions and said: 'Escape! Allah has killed Abu Rafi'.' I went to the Prophet, peace be upon him, and told him. He said: 'Stretch out your leg.' I stretched out my leg, and he wiped it, and it was as if I had never complained of it.\"",

He said: 'O son of al-Akwa', you have gained possession, so be lenient.' Then he said: 'They are now being hosted by Ghaṭfan.'\" The cry for help in Medina reached the Banu Amr ibn Awf, and reinforcements came. Horses continued to arrive, and men on foot and on camels until they reached the Messenger of Allah, peace be upon him, at Dhi Qarad. The Prophet, peace be upon him, reached a watering place called Dhi Qarad. He slaughtered a she-camel from those he had recovered and stayed there for a day and a night, then returned to Medina. In this raid, al-Akhram, who was Muhriz ibn Nadlah, may Allah be pleased with him, was killed. Abd al-Rahman ibn 'Uyaynah killed him and rode away on his horse. Abu Qatadah then charged him and killed him, and recovered the horse, which had belonged to Mahmud ibn Maslamah.

They were a clan of Banu Bakr, and their leader was ʿUbayd ibn Kilāb. Muhammad ibn Maslamah and his companions set out, traveling by night and hiding during the day. When they raided them, the rest fled after Muhammad killed a number of them. The Muslims seized camels and sheep and arrived in Medina on the last night of Muḥarram, bringing with them Thumamah ibn Uthāl al-Ḥanafī, the chief of Banu Ḥanīfah. He had gone out in disguise to assassinate the Prophet, peace and blessings be upon him, by the order of Musaylimah the Liar. The Muslims captured him, and when they brought him, they tied him to one of the pillars of the Mosque. The Prophet, peace and blessings be upon him, went out to him and said, \"What do you have, O Thumamah?\" He replied, \"I have good, O Muhammad. If you kill, you kill one who has blood [to avenge]. If you bestow favor, you bestow it upon one who is grateful. And if you desire wealth, ask, and you will be given whatever you wish.\" So he left him. Then he passed by him again and said the same thing to him, and he replied as he had before. Then he passed by a third time and, after the previous conversation, said, \"Release Thumamah.\" So they released him. He went to a palm grove near the Mosque, bathed, then came and embraced Islam. He said, \"By Allah, there was no face on the face of the earth more hateful to me than your face, but now your face has become the most beloved of faces to me. And by Allah, there was no religion on the face of the earth more hateful to me than your religion, but now your religion has become the most beloved of religions to me. Your cavalry captured me while I intended to perform ʿUmrah.\" The Messenger of Allah, peace and blessings be upon him, gave him glad tidings and ordered him to perform ʿUmrah. When he arrived among the Quraysh, they said, \"Have you apostatized, O Thumamah?\" He said, \"No, by Allah, but I have embraced Islam with Muhammad, peace and blessings be upon him. And by Allah, not a single grain of wheat will come to you from Yamāmah unless the Messenger of Allah, peace and blessings be upon him, permits it.\" Yamāmah was the fertile region of Mecca. He returned to his land and prevented the transport of goods to Mecca until the Quraysh were in dire straits. They wrote to the Messenger of Allah, peace and blessings be upon him, imploring him by their kinship ties to write to Thumamah to allow them to transport food.

When they reached Ma'an in the land of Sham, the news reached them that Heraclius, the king of Rome, had descended upon the land of Bani Ma'ab – the land of Balqa – with one hundred thousand Romans and another hundred thousand from the Christians of Sham. The Muslims stayed in Ma'an for two nights, consulting about engaging their enemy, who numbered two hundred thousand. They said, \"Let us write to the Messenger of God, peace be upon him, to inform him of the number of our enemy, so that he may command us or send us reinforcements.\" Abdullah ibn Rawahah said, \"O people, what you dislike is what you set out to seek – meaning martyrdom. We do not fight people with numbers or strength; rather, we fight them with this [faith] with which God has honored us. So, march forth, for it is one of two good outcomes: either victory or martyrdom.\" The army agreed with this opinion and set out. When they reached the borders of Balqa, they encountered some of the legions with Heraclius near a village called Mu'tah. They fought, and Zayd ibn Harithah was killed. Ja'far ibn Abi Talib took the banner, and fought until his right hand was severed. He took the banner with his left hand, and it was severed. He then embraced it and was killed in that manner. Abdullah ibn Rawahah took the banner and hesitated for a moment before dismounting, then he resolved and fought until he was killed. Thabit ibn Aqram took the banner and said, \"O Muslims, agree upon one of your own.\" They said, \"You.\" He said, \"No.\" The people agreed upon Khalid ibn al-Walid. When he took the banner, he defended the people and rallied them. Then he retreated, and they retreated with him, until he withdrew with the Muslims who were with him. Khalid ibn al-Walid said, \"On the day of Mu'tah, nine swords broke in my hand, and nothing remained in my hand but a Yemeni blade.\" This implies that they inflicted heavy casualties upon the enemy, for otherwise, they would not have been able to extricate themselves. For this reason and others, some scholars have concluded that the Muslims were victorious in this battle and were not defeated. Anas, may God be pleased with him, reported that the Prophet, peace be upon him, informed the people of the deaths of Zayd, Ja'far, and Ibn Rawahah before their news reached them.

The purpose of this expedition was to scout a caravan of Quraysh and to fight a tribe from Juhaynah. He provided them with a waterskin of dates, which Abu Ubaidah rationed out to them, to the point where he had to count them, giving each man one date per day. One day, when he distributed them, a date was missing for one man, and he noticed its absence that day. When their provisions ran out, they ate khabat, which is the leaves of the salim tree. The army was therefore named the \"Army of Khabat.\" They suffered severe hunger. Qais ibn Sa'd ibn Ubadah, who was one of the soldiers in this expedition, slaughtered three young camels, then three more, and then three more. Abu Ubaidah then forbade him. The sea then cast forth an animal for them, called the 'anbar. They ate from it for twenty nights and used its fat for anointing, until their bodies recovered and improved. Abu Ubaidah took one of its ribs and measured it against the tallest man in the army and the tallest camel, and the camel was ridden under it. They also took provisions of its meat, dried in strips. When they returned to Medina, they came to the Messenger of God, peace and blessings be upon him, and told him about it. He said, \"It is a provision that God brought forth for you. Do you have any of its meat with you to feed us?\" They sent some of it to the Messenger of God, peace and blessings be upon him, and he ate it.",

It is said that it was named Hunayn after a man called Hunayn ibn Qabithah ibn Mahla'il. The Prophet, peace be upon him, had stayed in Mecca for 19 days until Hawazin and Thaqif came and camped in Hunayn, intending to fight the Prophet, peace be upon him. They had gathered before that when they heard of the departure of the Messenger of Allah, peace be upon him, from Medina, thinking that he was coming for them. When they learned that he had arrived in Mecca, they began to prepare to confront him. They intended it to be a decisive battle, so they mobilized their wealth, women, and children so that none of them would flee and abandon their families and property. Their leader was Malik ibn 'Awf al-Nadri, and they mobilized Ghatafan and others with them. The Messenger of Allah, peace be upon him, prepared to confront them. He borrowed thirty camels and thirty shields from Ya'la ibn Umayyah, and borrowed one hundred shields from Safwan ibn Umayyah. He appointed 'Attab ibn Asid ibn Abi al-'As as governor of Mecca. It is confirmed in the two Sahih collections that the freed slaves (al-tulaqa') went out with him to Hunayn. The Messenger of Allah, peace be upon him, met the enemy with his army in the valley of Hunayn in the early morning. They descended into it, and upon entering the valley, they attacked Hawazin, who were routed. The Muslims then fell upon the spoils they had left behind. While they were in this state, Hawazin confronted them and rained down a volley of arrows upon them. The Muslims had not expected this, and the earth became straitened for them. They turned and fled, not looking back. The Messenger of Allah, peace be upon him, turned to the right, saying: \"Where are the people? Come to me! I am the Messenger of Allah! I am the Messenger of Allah! I am Muhammad ibn Abdullah.\" The Messenger of Allah, peace be upon him, ordered his uncle Al-Abbas – who had a loud voice – to call out to the people to stand firm, specifically mentioning the companions of the Pledge of Ridwan. They rushed to him, then he called out to the Ansar, then to the Banu al-Harith ibn al-Khazraj, and they flew to him, saying: \"Labbayk, Labbayk\" (Here we are, here we are). A fierce battle ensued against Hawazin. When the Messenger of Allah, peace be upon him, saw the battle intensifying, he said: \"This is when the furnace has heated up.\" Then he took some pebbles – or dust – and threw them at the faces of the disbelievers, saying: \"May the faces be disfigured.\" No one among them whom Allah created was spared from having his eyes filled with dust from that handful. They turned and fled, and the Messenger of Allah, peace be upon him, said: \"By the Lord of Muhammad, they are defeated.\" In another narration: \"By the Lord of the Ka'bah, they are defeated! By the Lord of the Ka'bah, they are defeated!\" It has been narrated that the killed from Banu Malik of Thaqif alone reached 70. At Awstas, 300 from Banu Malik were killed, and a large number from Banu Nasr ibn Mu'awiyah, then from Banu Ri'ab, were killed.

      "details": "Al-Aswad al-Ansi – whose name was Abhalah ibn Ka'b ibn Gawth – emerged in the final days of the life of the Messenger of Allah, peace be upon him, with seven hundred fighters. He wrote to the agents of the Prophet, peace be upon him, saying: \"O rebels against us, return to us what you have taken from our land, and keep what you have gathered, for we are more deserving of it, and you remain as you are.\" Then he proceeded with his fighters to Najran and captured it. Afterward, he intended for Sana'a. Shahar ibn Bazham came out to him, and they fought. Al-Aswad defeated and killed him, and married Shahar ibn Bazham's wife, who was the daughter of Fayruz al-Daylami's cousin. Her name was Azadh, and she was a believer in Allah and His Messenger, peace be upon him, and among the righteous. Al-Ansi occupied Sana'a. Mu'adh ibn Jabal and Abu Musa al-Ash'ari went to Hadhramaut, and the agents of the Messenger of Allah, peace be upon him, retreated to Al-Tahir. Umar ibn Haram and Khalid ibn Sa'id ibn al-'As returned to Medina. Yemen became secured for Al-Aswad al-Ansi, and his affair began to spread like wildfire. His rule intensified, and his situation grew grave. A group of the people of Yemen apostatized. The Muslims there dealt with him with dissimulation. When the news of Al-Aswad al-Ansi reached him, the Messenger of Allah, peace be upon him, sent his letter with Qays ibn Makshuh, ordering the Muslims there to fight and confront Al-Ansi. Mu'adh ibn Jabal took charge of this letter perfectly. Mu'adh ibn Jabal and those who rallied around him from the people of Yemen, and Qays ibn Abd Yaghuth, the commander of Al-Aswad's army, and Fayruz al-Daylami, agreed to assassinate Al-Aswad and kill him. They pledged to do so. When night fell, they entered his house. Fayruz al-Daylami approached him. Al-Aswad was sleeping on a silk mattress, his head sunk into his body, snoring heavily, with the woman sitting beside him. Fayruz attacked him and grappled with him, who was like a camel. He seized his head, crushed his neck, and placed his knees on his back until he killed him. Qays, Dadhuwayh, and Fayruz sat planning how to inform their followers. They agreed that in the morning, they would call out their rallying cry, which was between them and the Muslims. When morning came, one of them – Qays – stood on the rampart of the fortress and called out their rallying cry. The Muslims and the disbelievers gathered around the fortress. Qays then cried out: \"I bear witness that Muhammad is the Messenger of Allah, and that Abhalah is a liar!\" He threw his head down to them. His followers fled, and people pursued them, capturing and ambushing them on every road, taking them prisoner. Islam and its adherents prevailed. The deputies of the Messenger of Allah, peace be upon him, returned to their posts. They agreed that Mu'adh ibn Jabal would lead the people in prayer. They wrote the news to the Messenger of Allah, peace be upon him. The duration of his rule, from his emergence until his death, was three or four months.",
